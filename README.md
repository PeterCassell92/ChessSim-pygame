# ChessSim-pygame

A Basic Chess Game Built in Pygame for python 2.7.

Running main.py (with pygame installed) will run an in-window 2d game of chess. The user can play a local game of chess and the game logic limits players to only be able to make legal chess moves.

The game ends once either White or Black checkmates their opponent.

This is the first major solo project I have completed. As such, the core of the program has been built clunkily which limits the ease of adding new functionality.

Functionality that I may yet add would be:-
Playing against a computer opponent.
Replaying chess matches loaded from online records.

v1.0 has been released as an executable file for Linux and as an msi installer for Windows.
